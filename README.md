The files in this repository are part of my PhD project on characterization through direct speech in ancient Greek epic. 
The first stage of the project is developing computational methods to quantify style. 
Python code and results of the methods will be uploaded here.

So far, the list of stylistic features I'm working on includes:
  - Chiasmus
  - Polyptoton
  - Homoeoteleuton
  - Paronomasia
  - Anaphora
  - Isocolon
  - Enumeration
  - Alliteration and assonance
